       In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?
      </li>
      <li>
        In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?
      </li>
      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?</li>

        <p>
          1.Yes, it is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Yes, we can make a infinite loop by changing the number to a number it cant find. Then it will look for that number for eternity without being able to find it.

          3. It depends on the CPU which depends on the GHz its capable to use. It can usually guess millions if not billions of times every second.
            While its guessing and if the program is single-threaded it can't multitask while its running.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Yes, you can change the order.
